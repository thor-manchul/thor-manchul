`Computer Science @ University of Calgary | SWE & Security Enthusiast`

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Calgary, who's passionate about building systems that are as secure as they are well-designed.  
I believe every technical choice — from a data structure to a framework — should have a clear "why" behind it, established before a line of code is written. 
I'm continuously learning, building projects that push me into new territory, and developing a security-first mindset with every project I develop.

### 🚀 Featured Project
**[Commute Dashboard](https://github.com/thor-manchul/Commute-Dashboard)** — I got tired of manually checking Google Maps every morning to figure out when I needed to leave. So I built the solution: a Python dashboard that pulls real-time travel data and sends an alert before I need to walk out the door. The goal was simple but the constraints were real — reliable data handling, clean notification logic, and secure API credential management from day one.
